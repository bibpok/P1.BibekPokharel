    <h1> Microwave Design </h1>
    <img src ="Work Microwave copy.jpg" alt = "Microwave used for project "
    style="width:500px;height:600px;>
    <p1> <b>Main issue with the current design:</b>
	I found this microwave in my Work. I face some issue while trying to use this microwave. Myself having color deficiency issue with Red, Green and Yellow, I could not properly set the timer at first place. 
•	This microwave use color to indicate where the timer is set. This microwave is hard to use by color blindness people.
•	In this microwave there is only the timer button so, if you do not know how much time it takes to heat a particular item, you have to guess the random time and keep trying until it is heated properly.
•	 This microwave also does not have the display screen where you can see how much time is remaining to cook or what operation is microwave performing.
•	This microwave also does not have time display.
•	This microwave also does not have proper warning message, Like for the use of steel dishes.
•	I don’t like the handle of this microwave. From my personal experience I have seen such handle been broken after few months of use.
•	Like in modern microwave this microwave does not have vent fan.
•	Overall user interface is confusing. It does not have start or stop button which can be used to start or stop the Microwave.
