    <p> <b>Main issue with the current desig:<br></b>
	   I found this microwave in my Work. I face some issue while trying to use this microwave. Myself having color deficiency issue with Red, Green and Yellow, I could not properly set the timer at first place.<Br>
     •	This microwave use color to indicate where the timer is set. This microwave is hard to use by color blindness people.<br>
     •	 This microwave also does not have the display screen where you can see how much time is remaining to cook or what operation is microwave performing.<br>
    •	This microwave also does not have time display.<br>
    •	This microwave also does not have proper warning message, Like for the use of steel dishes.<br>
    •	I don’t like the handle of this microwave. From my personal experience I have seen such handle been broken after few months of use.<br>
    •	Like in modern microwave this microwave does not have vent fan.<br>
    •	Overall user interface is confusing. It does not have start or stop button which can be used to start or stop the Microwave.<br>
